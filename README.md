	Battery powered Autonomous Cars replaces the current fuel monsters on road. They hold the promise of lower traffic accidents, short commute times, free personal time to indulge, to name just a few of such changes afoot. The shredding of automobiles results in automobile shredder residue off approx. 3 million tons in European nations. In addition to that regenerative braking recovers 5-10% of energy wastage. All of this is made possible by advances in battery capacity that increase driving range, marriage of artificial intelligence and computing power that make possible near instantaneous decisions.
	Our project aims to make promise into a reality. Electric drive system will be modified to a more efficient motor drive system. Special gear transmission designed by us will transfer the power from the motor to the car trans axle to further increase efficiency. Our controller along with the motor will provide effective autonomous driving experience. Linear map using different sensors will be used for emergency braking. GPS data along with camera will provide relative position of the car in the environment. Fuzzy based output will control brake. Regenerative braking will provide braking with less power loss.
